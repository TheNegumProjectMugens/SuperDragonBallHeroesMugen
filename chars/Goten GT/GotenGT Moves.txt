Kamehameha               - D,DF,F,D,DF,F, x (Power >= 2000)

SSJ Transformation       - x + z
                         - 1st Time transform can be done at any time!
                         - Power continually slowly increases!
			 - However instead of decreasing power while in fly state,
			   power increase is just stopped.
                         - And if you use too much power continuously and power
                           gets TOO low, Goten will revert to Normal form!
                         - USE YOUR POWER WISELY!
                         
                         - Transforming again can be done but only if power is 
			   already at 3000!
                         - Every other rule for SSJ Mode still applies!
