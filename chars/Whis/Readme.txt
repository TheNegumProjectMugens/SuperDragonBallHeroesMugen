He's the cheapest char of all MUGEN history, NO ONE CAN BEAT HIM !!!
(If he's been beaten, let me know, I'll fix that easily...)

Some jokes on Chuck Norris that gave me ideas (thanks to titansurge for bringin' some) :

Chuck Norris can hold a deadly hyper lazer proton cannon with one hand.
Chuck Norris' mere footsteps can cause massive earthquakes.
Chuck Norris can make a nuclear explosion with a point of the finger.
Chuck Norris doesn't kick people into the sun. He kicks the sun into people!

There's a new killer code I took from STMC which can kill some chars I couldn't beat before.
When I tested it the first time, it worked ; but when I inserted new sprites, for UNKNOWN REASON, it doesn't work anymore :( !
So... I added some stuff to help you to kill'em all anyway with the F5 an F1 keys.
(Sometimes the enemy dies instantly and the round is over, so you don't need to press these keys)
That's cheating, I know, but it's for the pleasure of killing before I fix it.
