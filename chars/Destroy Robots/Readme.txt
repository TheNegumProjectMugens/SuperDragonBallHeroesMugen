- Mugen char based from Duck Hunt for the Nintendo Entertainment System
- For Linux and Windows Mugen only



=====<Features>=====

- The key features from the original game, except you can't play it with a light gun =P
- Intro just like in the original
- Three kinds of ducks
- The annoying dog that catches the ducks or laughs at you if you let them fly away
- Score system



=====<What's Missing>=====

- Maybe adding a Hit and Missed ducks counter
- More kinds of ducks?
- Make the ducks react to more moves



=====<Introduction>=====

  This is a Bonus Stage inspired in the Duck Hunt game for the NES. I felt that I had to do
this as a homage to the time I spent playing that game with friends and family, just like you
probably did too, and with April Fools coming I thought that this would be a nice way to
"celebrate".

  Anyway, just like in the original game the goal here is to hit as many ducks as possible to
reach a high-score, but since Mugen is a fighting game engine you'll have to hit them without
a light gun by using any moves you want from your character, from your regular
jabs to super beams. You can even throw them!

  There are three types of ducks, each having its own speed and giving you a different ammount
of points, as follows:

     Duck           Speed      Points
Black and green  |  Slow    |  10 * Damage
Blue and pink    |  Medium  |  15 * Damage
Red and black    |  Fast    |  20 * Damage

  So you see, in an effort to make things more interesting I made the points depend on the
damage you inflict on the ducks. So, to make a high-score you should try to hit the faster
ducks first, and with damaging attacks. Tip: an attack that does a lot of hits usually does
little damage on each hit, and since each duck can only take one hit you'll gain fewer
points that way.

  In the first round a duck will be spawned each 1.5 seconds, in the second round two ducks
will be spawned simultaneously each 2 seconds. If you're playing in Simul mode the ammount of
ducks doubles (max number of ducks on the screen is 12), fun for everyone. When a duck goes
against an edge of the screen it'll turn back, it'll do this for 5 seconds and then it may
fly away.

  You can play until the timer runs out, or until you decide to use the mighty F1 key. To
customize the time limit just check CONFIG.txt.

  Another thing, I made it so that when your char is on the left side of the screen it'll face
right and vice-versa, and homing attacks (such as Shin Gouki's Misogi) aim to the center of
the screen.

  Oh, and don't mind the dog, it doesn't interfere in the game and is just there for old times
sake. In any case, if he gets on your nerves you can just beat him up.



=====<Version History>=====

<27.01.09>
- Now supports using two bonus games in simul mode

<v.1.3>
- Score bonus and "Perfect" message if you don't let any duck escape, just like the original
- More frames of animation when ducks are falling
- Ducks will appear plucked if hit by projectiles
- More Config options
- Ducks can now fight back via a Config option
- Some events will cause extra ducks to appear


<v.1.2>
- Fixed bugs
- When a duck is close to the ground, it now acts like if it was a standing opponent, meaning
it can be hit by certain moves that can't hit jumping opponents (like regular ground throws)
- Throwing the ducks now adds to the score. Yes, super throws earn you a lot of points
- All ducks now die if an opponent performs some specific move. You only get points for the
hit ducks though
- Ducks immediately appear when the round starts, there is no more lag
- If a duck gets off the screen it will now get back faster
- Enabled time limit customization, check CONFIG.txt
- Limited the looping duck sounds to 6 ducks at a time, to go easier on sound cards
- Some required anims now use ducks instead of being invisible, just to make some throws look
funnier
- Lifebars show if Duck Hunt has a partner


<v.1.1>

any points, though (I may change this in the future)
