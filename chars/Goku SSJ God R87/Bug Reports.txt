+Power charge sounds should be limited to one or two channels-(try spamming b+y for ex)-fixed
+Landing from a y dick kick plays the jump sound again,jump sound overused.-fixed
-Zanzoken\dashes allow for time over?(not a big worry); air movement limit suggegested
+Ki toss projectile cel's could look nicer if used with veladd.-nicer? they turned nutty!
-custom states make p2 use anims that arent required by mugen, fucking up people

+State 105 plays a sound that is immediatley stopped by the negative states-fixed
-kaiouken effects need removeongethit=1-fixed?
