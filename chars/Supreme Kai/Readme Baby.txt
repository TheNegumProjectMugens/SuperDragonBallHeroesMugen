CAUTION:

All the sourse, fx and sprites made by Dgz Team is NOT OPEN SOURSE
If you wanna use fxs like auras, charges kames, kames, masenko, explosion, and others original stuff, YOU MUST HAVE PERMISSION.
If you use the fxs without my permission you will have problems.
Sorry but we want originality and own style to do mugen stuff...

My opinion: The open sourse is good for newbies and for use a few classic stuff... 
BUT if you're pretend to use all open sourse key, then you're a weak guy without originality... 
you're killing mugen and abuse the works of others cool guys. just PATHETHIC....
My recomendation: learn to do your own stuff.

"Dream, Think, Don't watch anybody's project and Try to do yourself"

Mugen is fun, but when u get older... u'll noticed that there's more important stuff than just mugen... 
enjoy while u can, don't be so hard to people who create their own chars using somebody else's codes... 
let others be the judge how good the char will be... 
u guys can't be angry forever just because of this small thing rite...

The brickbats anybody put on me, it's ok... i don't really mind, different people different opinions

To newbies... just be creative... and don't abuse... 

Thanks you all... ;)
