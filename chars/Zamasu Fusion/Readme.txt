=Chains Combos=

---------------------------

Vegetto is built on a chain combos system, his gameplay authorise a lot of combinations.
Try for exemple:



x + y + y (Stand state) - Punch combos

a + b + b (Stand state) - Kick combos    

Down b + Down y - to put the opponent in his fall state.

x + x + x + x (Air state) - fast air combos 

y + y + y (Air state) - slow/heavy air combos 

Air a + Air b - Air kicks chain




There is a lot of possibilities, find them by yourself =P.

          Goku and Vegetto from Hyper Dimension (snes)

          DW did a great job, I edited his sheet with customs sprites (some from HD), new stand, and smoother animations 
          (+1 frame in each basics move). 
  



Beta testers:
------------

Pextin, Roken, Neocide, Neotokyo, Toad, Annubis



Known bugs:
---------

    _


Problems to fix:
----------------

Things to do:
------------

- AI ?!

- Alternatives palettes ?!


Hope maybe a patch in the future 



Litle word:
-----------

DW spent a lot of time on the sprite sheet. Toad spent a lot of time on the gfx. I personnaly got many headach 
with that char.


IN ANY CASE: YOU AREN'T AUTHORISED TO USE ANYTHING FROM THE .SFF OF THAT CHAR: SPRITES & GFX
===========
A certain code interest you, you want to implement it in your char? Go ahead, but CREDIT ME. You aren't authorised 
to take Vegito as a base for your char.

Please respect my choice, or all my new chars will go private.


Black list:
----------

- Sniknot http://sniknot-m.ifrance.com/ : that dick is making a Vegetto with sprites and code from an old beta of mine i
                                          got leaked. A piece of stolen stuff as usual. Some of his friends stole sprites 
                                          from DW or jedi. Please hate those fellas.


- MugenFury : find a brain.


- Daki (from don't know where XD) : How many tmes did you request my Vegito stupid? Please stop that, i thought to 
                                     keep Vegito private with such attitude.


All actually =P. Want to enter in the black list? contact me =P
