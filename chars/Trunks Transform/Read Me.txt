=======Info:

Clashable; with these chars made by me
Madara, Naruto kurama, And piccolo Himself

There is an intro and ending story mode check it 
out when you battle in mugen arcade mode or story mode

The char has many special tricks, 
and some hidden stuff.The char also has 
a second form which You can choose during the intro. 
The movelist is in the char itself, just 
hold Down and C&Y&S(Enter). If you find any 
bugs that you want me to fix, contact me 
at my site. This is one of my best dbz Chars. 
Theres an AI patch, so if you want The char 
with a stronger AI just open the Ai Patch 
Folder and read the ReadMe Note before adding 
it in the char.
