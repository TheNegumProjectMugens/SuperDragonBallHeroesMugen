Character's History... Goku Legend or Namek Goku?

Goku is usually recognized by his uniquely styled hair, which never changes its length throughout the series except 
when in his Super Saiyan forms, in which his hair turns blond and changes its length based on the level he ascends to.

This wip started three years ago (on'05), but we missed the char, and now thanks to Neocide this character is back to the life.

CAUTION:

All the sourse, fx and sprites made by Dgz Team is NOT OPEN SOURSE
If you wanna use fxs like auras, charges kames, kames, masenko, explosion, and others original stuff, YOU MUST HAVE
OWN PERMISSION OF THE DGZ TEAM.
If you use the fxs without my permission you will have problems.
Sorry but we want originality and own style to do mugen stuff...

My opinion: The open sourse is good for newbies and for use a few classic stuff... 
BUT if you're pretend to use all open sourse key, then you're a weak guy without originality... 
you're killing mugen and abuse the works of others cool guys. just PATHETHIC....
My recomendation: learn to do your own stuff.

Thanks to:

Neocide: for share the sheet ;)
Roken: For give permission to use his hair ssj.

You for download it.

----- Not to forget -----

Mugen is fun, but when u get older... u'll noticed that there's more important stuff than just mugen... 
let others be the judge how good the char will be... 

The brickbats anybody put on me, it's ok... i don't really mind, different people different opinions

To newbies... just be creative... don't abuse... and enjoy!

Thanks you all... ;)
