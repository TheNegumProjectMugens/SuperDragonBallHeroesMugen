Character Information:
	Trunks is a Z-Warrior from the future, sent back in time by the request of his mother, Bulma. He travelled 
to the past to warn of the news of the Androids created by Dr.Gero to destroy earth and also give Goku special 
medicine for his future heart disease so the earth could have a fighting chance. During the battle battle with the 
Androids a new enemy emerged that even Trunks was unaware of! This new enemy was Cell. A long battle between the 
Androids, Cell, and the Z-Warriors finally ended, when Gohan transformed and destroyed Cell. Trunks left for his own 
time after Cell was destroyed to defeat the Androids of his own time period, and he did so, with relative ease. 

Trouble strikes again when Trunks returns to the past for a visit and a bit of fun at a martial arts tournament. Now 
Bojack and his band of space pirates threatens the earth! Is there anyway Trunks and the others can stop them?
