		<b>A Little Introduction</b><br><br>
	
	Not so much to say about this character. It's the mighty Satan, the Champion who supposedly killed Cell and saved Earth. As everybody knows, he's actually more of a wuss and a running joke in the Dragon Ball Universe. However, he still helped Goku kill Kid Buu, so he's not completely useless.<br><br>
	
	This character was made as an April Fool's joke for 2012, and was originally created in about 10 days, spriting, coding and sound ripping included. It all started with a joke Iced made, Balthazar and I then agreed to make a Mr Satan who would play as well as he fights in the series, with tons of references to Dragon Ball.<br><br>
	
	Head to the Credits section to see all the people who've helped us make this new Z2 character become true. We hope you'll enjoy him and reserve a spot for him in your Mugen, because he's more than just a joke once you get to know him a little.<br><br>

<hr>

If you find infinites (LOL), please report.<br>
If you think some moves or combos are really unbalanced (LOL), please report or contact me, I will see what I can do.<br><br>

Note that this character was built for Winmugen (Plus). At this point, I cannot ensure everything will work correctly in Mugen 1.0, moreover in widescreen resolution. It will definitely have bugs if you play with it using Mugen 1.1, since the zooming feature isn't taken into account in this version of Satan Z2.<br><br>
