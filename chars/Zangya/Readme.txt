Readme.txt file for Super Zangya by SSj3 Vejita.
Character version 1.05
Designed for M.U.G.E.N v 2001.04.14

1. Introduction.
If you notice any bugs, email me. Also, your private opinion is welcome. Any
ideas how to improve my character are welcome too. My favourite DBZ game is 
Super Butouden 2. Why?? Well, because:
1. There is Zangya.
2. It has better graphic than SB1 and a story mode that SB3 missed.
3. It is the only Super Butouden game where i have access to debug mode 
   (accident).
4. It's the only game which uses DBZ movies as a story mode. 8 and 9 Movie are
   my favourite movies.

2. Zangya's characteristics.
Name                : Zangya
Last name           : none
Race                : Unknown (Hera-jin is the closest idea(SB2))
Related (somehow) to: Bojack(Boss), Buujin, Bidou, Gokuha (other Bojack henchmen)
Bloodtype           : Unknown
Place of birth      : Unknown (possibly created by Bojack along with other henchmen)
Date of Birth       : Unknown (if earlier theory is true, then she's very young)
Likes               : To fight, to kill... standard badguy stuff blah blah blah...
Dislikes            : For some unknown reasons Zangya almost never uses her KI in
                      anime. She prefers to beat her enemy to a pulp in hand-to-hand fight.
Techniques          : Buukujutsu, Finger laser, Laser threads (in anime she used only that).
Other things        : Almost nothing is known about Zangya. When Bojack was released
                      after Kaioh's death, he was supposed to create his henchmen.
                      They have arrived to earth and killed 4 "aliens" which were Mr.
                      Satan's students and they were supposed to fight the 4 winners of 
                      a special tournament organised for a very rich man's son(he was Mr.
                      Satan's fan). Four winners were: Gohan, some sumo guy, Trunks and 
                      Kuririn. The sumo guy was killed by Bidou, Kuririn was almost killed
                      by Zangya, before he even started to fight, Trunks transformed to SSj 
                      and killed Gokuha, but Bojack knocked him out. Gohan was fighting
                      Buujin, and they went to a place where they meet Bojack. Sorry, no more 
                      Spoilers, just that she was betrayed by her boss and killed by him at the
                      end, after Gohan Goes SSj2 and kills Bidou and Buujin without any problem.
                      Why she died? Either because she showed fear, or Bojack wanted to
                      distract Gohan and deal with him (it didn't worked). Zangya's power level
                      is about 288,000,000. She doesn't speak very much. In anime she has spoken
                      only once.

How everybody looks : The way they're dressing is very similar - Wide pants(like Gokuh's)
                      a vest(or blouse with very wide shoulders) and yellow boots with some 
                      grey steel parts. They have blue skin and orange hair. They can transform once, 
                      after which their skin turn green and hair red and muscles grow several
                      times(men). To transform they probably use a pendant that everybody wears.
                      After the transform their upper clothing is destroyed (by their big muscles).
                      They also wear earrings.

                      Zangya - Long curly hair, likes to fight hand-to-hand. Probably the
                      strongest of Bojack's henchmen. She is rather short.

                      Bidou - Punk-styled hair, with beard, big muscles, uses ki and fights
                      rather equally. The tallest of the group.

                      Buujin - The shortest, wears a turban-like thing, depends on his mind
                      games. He has a blouse with wide shoulders.

                      Gokuha - Trunks-like hair, the weakest of all. Uses sword. Transforms.
                      He has a blouse with wide shoulders.

                      Bojack - The boss, wears a bandana on his head (like Pan). Uses mostly ki.
                      The strongest Badguy in Movie 9. Dies because of kamehameha by SSj2 Gohan. 
                      Transforms. He wears lots of jewelery and has a blouse with wide shoulders.

to fire again).

                                           - some characters haven't got the clsn2's set
                                             (or nothitby on) and hitting them is impossible
                                             while they perform their Hypers (like goku-n-hd,

                                           - it only goes in straight line (kakusan energy dan is a powerful
                                             energy beam, that before it hits enemy, goes up and splits into
                                             several smaller fireballs and they are seeking their enemy until
                                             they hit him)

                                         - advantages:
                                           - very fast
                                         - disadvantages:
                                           - uses a lot of energy (200 per fireball)

Hyper moves:
Shoot Blaster - D-DB-B-F-a             - Powerful Ball of energy formed in one hand and shoted with 
                                         other one (Jiisu's Crusher Ball clone)
                                        - power needed - 1500 (can be done at 1200, but you'll get tired)
                                         - advantages: 
                                           - can be holded (hold a to hold it)
                                           - you can turn when holding it
                                           - can be directed diagonally (hold up or down)
                                           - timer is freezed during this action
                                           - big damage
                                         - disadvantages:
                                           - very slow charging
                                           - drains power while holding
                                           - when firing it's direction cannot be changed anymore

What, no Spark laser?? No, because is is a stupid idea (what were Bandai 
guys thinking when inventing this move). Zangya doesn't have any of these 
Hyper KI attacks in anime, and most of the Ki supers Bandai just copied 
from Trunks instead of inventing something new. Blah.

4. Overall.
She uses SB2 sprites. But she also has some sprite edit, and finally, she has 
several frames drawn completly by me. So i would apreciate if you wouldn't 
steal them from me. OR ELSE...
Zangya mostly relays on her combos, so her main advantage is speed. She is not
as powerfull as others, but her combos may be deadly if not blocked or escaped 
in time. Her Hyper, the Shoot Blaster is charged slowly, and that's it's 
weakness but it's very powerful, so if you're playing against her, don't let 
her finish it. Zanzoken allows you to escape from blocking. Kakusan Eenergy Dan 
(despite it's name) travels only on the straight line, but it's very fast 
and consists of 3 fireballs, so it takes 3 times as much damage and power 
consumption as one fireball. All of my chars use 3000 power. The final version 
includes AI. Almost every piece of code here was programmed by me (some by my 
buddy Burori), and if you'll accuse me of stealing (or steal my coding), i'm 
gonna get you.

Burori                    - Code (flying, floating, laser, old zanzoken), aura, explosions
Detah                     - Idea - Super Renzoku Energy Dan (my version, only changble 
                            velocities).
The Necromancer           - Idea for exploding fireball sound when it hits another
                            projectile (idea of creating a dummy Helper, which triggers 
                            the sound when the fireball dies). Written my own code.

6. Suckers/Lamers/other unworthy people/aliens/stuff like that.
Zarbon - for being the worst DBZ badguy ever. He simply SUCK!!
Bojack - for killing Zangya.
If somebody will steal/spriteswap any of my chars/codes and say "he/she made 
it" or just insult me in any other way without a clear reason, he/she'll be 
here. Ask for permission (for code, you can rip the sprites by yourself i hope.
If not then tough luck. Go and find some spritesheets.) if you liked something
in my char and would like to use in your own.

Stages:
Plains                 - My first stage, equipped with MP3 BGM, Infinite.(100%).
Blizzard               - My Second stage, equipped with MP3 BGM, Infinite.(100%). Designed for FSj Vejita.

Desert                 - Fifth stage, equipped with MP3 BGM, Infinite(100%). Designed for Super Zangya.

Add-ons/Screenpacks:
Super Butouden 3 - HD style - 105%, but still needs intro and credits. Other fonts removed.
Super Butouden 2            - 100%. Final Version 1.2. Fully functional. Includes credits.
DBZ Mugen Edition 2 patch   - 100%. Updates DBZME2 to version 04.14.2001. Removes expiration.

9. New stuff in this version:
     1) Cheapness of constant countering removed.
     2) Some new kickass effects (thanx Burori).

10. Bugs
1)   Necromancer's Piccolo tends to place her in custom state when countering
     his throw (p2customstate bug i think). He sometimes place her in a custom 
     state when AI is on, and Zangya simply "fly off" somewhere. Restart.
2)   When fighting Necro's Piccolo, and there is a flash fight, sometimes 
     Piccolo takes Zangya's graphic for the rings instead of his own.
