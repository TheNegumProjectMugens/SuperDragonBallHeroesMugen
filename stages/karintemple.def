 ;Name of the stage.

[Camera]
 ;Camera starting position: Usually 0 for both
 ;***
startx = 0
starty = 0

 ;Left and right bound of camera
 ;You may want to fiddle a bit with these values to make sure the
 ;background doesn't move too far or too little
 ;***
boundleft =  -78
boundright = 80

 ;High and low bound of camera
 ;High is a negative number. Make is more negative if you want to
 ;camera to be able to move higher.
 ;Low should usually be 0.
 ;If omitted, defaults to -25 and 0 respectively
 ;***
boundhigh = -28
boundlow = 0

 ;This is how much the camera will move vertically towards the
 ;highest player. Valid values are from 0 to 1. A value of 0 will mean
 ;the camera does not move up at all. A value of 1 will makes the camera
 ;follow the highest player.
 ;Typically .2 for normal-sized backgrounds. You may need to pull this
 ;value up for taller backgrounds.
verticalfollow = .2

 ;Distance player is from edge before camera starts to move. Typically 50
tension = 50
floortension = 100

[PlayerInfo]
;--- Player 1 ---
 ;Player 1 starting coordinates.
 ;p1startx is typically -70 and p2startx is 70.
 ;p1starty and p1startz should be 0.

;--- Common ---
 ;Don't change these values.

rightbound =  1000 ;Right bound
topbound  =  0     ;Top bound (z-movement)

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Scaling]
 ;No need to change these values

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Bound]
 ;Distance from left/right edge of screen that player can move to
 ;Typically 15
screenleft = 15    ;Dist from left of screen that player can move to
screenright = 15   ;Right edge

;--------------------------------------------------------
[StageInfo]
 ;Z offset for drawing
 ;Adjust this value to move the ground level up/down in the screen.
 ;It's the position where the players stand at.
 ;Up - smaller, Down - larger
 ;***
zoffset   = 205   ;Z offset for drawing

 ;Leave this at 1. It makes the players face each other
autoturn  = 1      ;Turn to face closest target

;--------------------------------------------------------
[Shadow]
 ;This is the shadow color given in r,g,b. Valid values for each
 ;range from 0 (lightest) to 255 (darkest).
 ;Defaults to 92,92,92 if omitted.
color = 55,55,55

 ;This is the scale factor of the shadow. Use a big scale factor
 ;to make the shadow longer. You can use a NEGATIVE scale factor
 ;to make the shadow fall INTO the screen.
 ;Defaults to 0.4 if omitted.
yscale = 0.2


;--------------------------------------------------------
[Music]
 ;Put a filename for an MP3 or MIDI here, or just comment
 ;it out if you don't want music. If an invalid filename
 ;is given, then no music will play.
